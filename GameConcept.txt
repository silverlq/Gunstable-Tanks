Tank SHMUP game. Gun is unstable and can explode at any minute.

Each shot decreases durability, but there is a % chance of critical failure, where durability is decreased X 10. Incoming damage does the same.

When gun explodes, there is no ranged attack and player must use melee instead.

When enemies die, they drop their own weapons, but they follow the same rules as player, so their gun durability may be low.

Two types of tanks, then boss (Big tank, lol).

Weapon types
Normal - steady long range pellets
Machine gun - rapid fire small pellets
Shotgun - short range, many small pellets
Sniper - charge time, plus instant high damage (no pellet) *lowest priority
No gun - charge time, then rams forward, melee damage

Wrench - can be used to repair tank, but while in repair mode cannot move. Wrench breaks after a certain amount of repair.

Health - after gun health is zero, damage goes to core heath. Player dies when core health is zero.
